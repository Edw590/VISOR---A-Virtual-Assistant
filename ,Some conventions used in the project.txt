-----------------------------------------------------------------
EVERYthing in the Utils directory must be OS-independent.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Naming formats of code, files, and folders:

- Variables: this_is_a_variable
- Constants: THIS_IS_A_CONSTANT
- Functions: thisIsAFunction
- Structs and Go files: ThisIsAStruct
- TXT files, for example: same as variables
- Folders: like a variable in case they're used by VISOR, or if they're not used (like documentation, for example),
then they must start with an upper case letter and be written normally.

If something that begins with an upper-case letter is not to be exported, it must start with an underscore.
If something that begins with a lower-case letter is to be exported, it will have to start with an upper-case letter
(¯\_(ツ)_/¯).

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Errors format:

3234_ERROR_[Origin ID]_[Error ID]

Origin: unique ID of each VISOR module OR "U" in case it's from one of the utilities files
Error ID: unique error ID for the Origin ID

Means there's a unique error ID for the module ID where it happens (there can exist various error IDs = 3, as long as
it's in different modules).

This format is used to identify the unique place in the entire VISOR project of where the error came from. The
explanation must be commented near where the error is written.
