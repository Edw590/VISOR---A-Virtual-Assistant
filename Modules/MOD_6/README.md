# V.I.S.O.R. - Online Information Checker
Online Information Checker module of V.I.S.O.R.

This repository is a submodule on the [V.I.S.O.R. - Server Version Assistant](https://github.com/Edw590/VISOR---Server-Version-Assistant) project (the main project).

## What it does
This module checks the Internet for information like weather and news and updates a file with the information it got.
This file can then be read by apps to get the information back, already ready for usage.

Check the `mod_user_info.json` file in the example folder. Edit it an put it in the module-specific folder inside the data folder that the module creates upon startup, together with the mod_gen_info.json file. This file configures the module information.

**PS:** no problem in using comments in the JSON files. They're all filtered.
